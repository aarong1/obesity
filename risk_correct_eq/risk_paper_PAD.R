Current smoking (OR 4.46, 95% CI 2.25–8.84), diabetes (OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.03–7.12), 
hypertension (OR 1.75, 95% CI 0.97–3.13), hypercholesterolemia (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.09–2.57), 
low kidney function (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.08–3.70) were positively associated with prevalent PAD. 
In this study, PAD prevalence appears to disproportionately affect blacks (OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.48–5.42).

Intermittent Claudification is symptom of Peripheral Arterial Disease
It occurs in about a third to half of cases
We are going to take the IC equation then and times by 12/5 (reciprocal of avg of 1/2, 1/3) as a measure of incidence
no lag

Need - prevalence though
