#tbl$coeff
# Different from the UK Biobank dementia risk score
# This one uses the THIN primary care database
# it also more explicitly encodes BMI for obesity intervention functions
# This one also encodes 5 year risk

# REF
# https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4722622/

# See supplementary appendix for example implementation

# Implications
# We used routinely collected primary care data to derive a relatively simple 
# new risk algorithm, predicting a new GP recorded dementia diagnosis within 
# 5 years, which worked well in those aged 60–79 years, but not in older 
# age groups. This supports the previous suggestion that given the steep rise 
# in risk of dementia at 80 years, it would be reasonable to test for dementia 
# beyond this point on the basis of age alone [19]. It is likely that risk scores 
# using traditional risk factors will not perform well in this population, 
# and a different approach might be needed to identify a higher risk group aged 
# 80 or above using, for example, measures of frailty.
